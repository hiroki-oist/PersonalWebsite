I was selected as a research intern under the "France Excellence Bourses" 2025, a French government scholarship program for Japanese doctoral students. I conducted collaborative research with Prof. Alexandre Pitti and Prof. Mathias Quoy at the Équipe Traitement de l'Information et Systèmes (Information Processing and Systems Team), CY Cergy-Paris Université.

<br />
In this research, we proposed a model that integrates predictive coding and class embedding, enabling trajectory generation, class recognition, and meta-recognition of recognition confidence in real time on a physical robot. A key contribution of this work is that these three functions are all realized within a single RNN model (not a combination of multiple modules), meaning that no task-specific retraining or separate computation is required. All three emerge from a unified process of prediction-error minimization, which keeps the model computationally lightweight and scalable.

<br />
While models such as PV-RNN can already handle generation and recognition within a single framework, to our knowledge, no existing single-model approach explicitly performs class identification along with meta-estimation of recognition confidence. Although large-scale models combining multiple modules can achieve this, they lack biological plausibility and are computationally too heavy for real-time operation.

<br />
This work has been submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) and is currently under review. I will share the details here once the paper is officially accepted and published.

<br />
For now, although it is still uncertain whether it will be accepted within the first six months of my stay in France, I am glad that we were able to submit the paper during this period.
