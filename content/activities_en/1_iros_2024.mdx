title: Participated in IROS2024 @Abu Dhabi
date: "2024-10-14"
summary: I participated in IROS (IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems) in Abu Dhabi with a Late Breaking Poster (LBP) presentation. As an extension of the Predictive-Coding inspired Variational RNN (PV-RNN), I analyzed how the internal state representations change when the number of learned motions is gradually increased through incremental learning, using principal component analysis (PCA). Since these are preliminary results, I presented them as an LBP, but I plan to further develop this work in more interesting directions in the future.

I attended the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2024, held in Abu Dhabi from October 14 to 18, 2024.

<br />
This was my first time attending an international conference in person since the COVID-19 pandemic, and I was genuinely excited even before the trip.

<br />
In my presentation, I extended previous research on the Predictive-Coding inspired Variational RNN (PV-RNN). Specifically, I analyzed how the internal state representations change when a robot incrementally learns new motions, using principal component analysis (PCA) to capture these changes.

<br />
Since PV-RNN learns each motion in a nonlinear manner, I hypothesized that incremental learning might lead to emergent novel behaviors. To test this, I incrementally increased the number of learned motions from four to nine by guiding a humanoid robot’s two arms. The results showed that the internal representations of different motions gradually began to blend together, as indicated by the expanding distributions observed in PCA space.

<br />
Unfortunately, even with nine motions, no creative or entirely novel behaviors emerged. I am currently considering how to further develop this line of research, but for now, I will put this study on hold as I am heading to France for an internship. Below are the poster presented at IROS and my participation certificate.
